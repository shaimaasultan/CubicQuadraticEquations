# Cubic Quadratic Equations
Cubic and Quadratic Equations and Zeta function Zeros
In this document, we will study a partial sum reminder distribution for a specific natural number set using a 
dynamically sliding window. Then we will present a cubic equation from this distribution and a formula to 
calculate this cubic equation zero. And then we will go through some applications of this Cubic equation using 
the basic algebraic concepts to explain the distribution of natural numbers.
The first part will go through natural number distributions using a dynamically sliding window.
The second part will go through quadratic and cubic equations and will see how to use them to explain the strip 
line of the Zeta function.
In the last part, we will go through so applications for this distribution to filter and get Prime numbers factors for 
a partial sum of specific series of odd numbers.
